- [ ] Implement React Native chat UI with message bubbles
- [ ] Connect to existing Convex chat API (`/api/chat`)
- [ ] Add chat tab to mobile navigation
- [ ] Test message sending/receiving functionality
- [ ] Handle loading states and error scenarios

### **1.3 Enhance Mobile Dashboard Analytics** üìä *Medium Impact*
- [ ] Analyze web dashboard components (`SectionCards`, `ChartAreaInteractive`)
- [ ] Research React Native chart libraries (react-native-chart-kit, victory-native)
- [ ] Port interactive chart components to React Native
- [ ] Add advanced metrics that match web dashboard
- [ ] Implement responsive chart behavior

---

## üîß PHASE 2: User Experience Alignment (1 week)

### **2.1 Navigation Consistency**
- [ ] Audit navigation patterns between web and mobile
- [ ] Standardize feature access patterns
- [ ] Ensure all major features accessible from both platforms
- [ ] Document navigation guidelines

### **2.2 Content Parity Review**
- [ ] Compare feature discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Decide on mobile homepage approach (simple vs marketing content)
- [ ] Align onboarding flows where possible

---

## üì± PHASE 3: Platform-Specific Optimizations (Ongoing)

### **3.1 Mobile-First Features** 
- [ ] Push notifications integration
- [ ] Offline support for core features
- [ ] Mobile-specific gestures and interactions
- [ ] Native platform UI patterns

### **3.2 Web-First Features**
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards
- [ ] Bulk operations interfaces
- [ ] Admin/management capabilities
- [ ] Desktop-optimized layouts

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)

### **Priority 1: Fix Chat Functionality**
```bash
# Fix CORS issue
npx convex env set FRONTEND_URL https://c7b6851e222b.ngrok.app

# Test WebApp chat works
# Then implement mobile chat
```

### **Priority 2: Mobile Chat Implementation**
1. Create `mobile/app/chat.tsx` 
2. Add chat tab to navigation
3. Implement chat UI components
4. Connect to Convex API

### **Priority 3: Verify Feature Parity**
1. Test all features on both platforms
2. Document remaining gaps
3. Update this roadmap

## üèÜ SUCCESS METRICS

**Target Feature Parity:**
- [ ] 90% feature parity between platforms
- [ ] Consistent core user experience
- [ ] All critical features accessible on both platforms
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations implemented

**Current Completion Status:**
- Authentication: ‚úÖ 100%
- Profile Management: ‚úÖ 100% 
- Subscription Management: ‚úÖ 100%
- Dashboard Basic: ‚úÖ 80%
- AI Chat: ‚ùå 20% (Web broken, Mobile missing)
- Advanced Analytics: ‚ö†Ô∏è 40% (Web advanced, Mobile basic)

---

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### **Architecture Decisions:**
- Mobile uses WebBrowser for Clerk UserProfile (approved approach)
- Chat API centralized in Convex backend
- Platform-specific UI implementations with shared backend

### **Development Guidelines:**
- Keep core business logic in Convex
- Platform-specific UI optimizations encouraged
- Maintain consistent data flows between platforms
